# GetRecruited Frontend - college-rec


## GetRecruited Technologies

The GetRecruited site is comprised of a Rails API backend, and a React/Redux frontend.

This ReadMe focuses on the frontend application.


#### What is a frontend?

When you visit our website you're interacting with two systems, a frontend application and a backend application. The frontend application is responsible for inputing  data from the user interface, displaying images, text and data on our web pages.

Points regarding the frontend technologies:

* React / Redux
* In local development the sever should be on localhost:3000
* dependencies:
  "auth0-js": "^9.0.0",
  "auth0-lock": "^11.0.0",
  "axios": "^0.17.1",
  "react-bootstrap": "^0.31.5",
  "redux-form": "^7.2.0",


#### Local Development Environment

_Fork the repo first._

git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME]/college-rec.git


cd college-rec


#### Running GetRecruited Frontend:

To run the frontend use the localhost:3000

You can now visit http://localhost:3000

to start the application locally:   npm start


## Finding An Issue

* If you have everything setup you can find issues to work on. **Get Recruited** uses Github's built-in issue tracker. A listing of all our issues can be found [here]https://github.com/bweathers3/college-rec/issues.

* Once you have found an issue, leave a comment stating that you plan to work on the issue. Once assigned to you, your mission is a go!


## Working On Your Issue

* From the forked and cloned repository on your environment, you can now create a [feature branch](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). It is a good idea to name your branch after the issue it is attached to.

   git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>


## Submitting Your Changes

* When you have completed work on your feature branch, you are ready to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

* Each pull request should:

  * Be tied to a single issue
  * Be named after the issue with the designated issue # as the name of the branch

* Once your pull request has been submitted, it will be reviewed by a team member. This process helps to familiarize more people with the codebase, and provides a second set of eyes and perspective to your new feature.

* If your code is accepted, it will be merged into the `master` branch.
